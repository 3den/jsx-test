# jsx-test

`jsx-test` is a tool that makes it easy to test '.jsx' files and includes some helpers for testing react components.

The main features of `jsx-test` are:

* Allows you to require `.jsx` files directly in your test.
* Includes some helpers to simplify the test of React Components.
* Assertion methods to check the component renders the correct html based on the given `props`.
* Does NOT automock your dependencies.
* Is much simpler and faster than Jest.
* Works with `mocha`, `jasmine` or any other test framework.

npm install --save-dev jsx-test
